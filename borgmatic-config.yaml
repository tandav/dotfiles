# Retention policy for how many backups to keep in each category. See
# https://borgbackup.readthedocs.org/en/stable/usage.html#borg-prune for details.
# At least one of the "keep" options is required for pruning to work.
retention:
    # Keep all archives within this time interval.
    keep_within: 3H

    # Number of minutely archives to keep.
    keep_minutely: 60

    # Number of hourly archives to keep.
    keep_hourly: 24

    # Number of daily archives to keep.

# Consistency checks to run after backups. See

consistency:
    # List of one or more consistency checks to run: "repository", "archives", and/or
    # "extract". Defaults to "repository" and "archives". Set to "disabled" to disable
    # all consistency checks. "repository" checks the consistency of the repository,
    # "archive" checks all of the archives, and "extract" does an extraction dry-run
    # of just the most recent archive.
    checks:
        - repository
        - archives
